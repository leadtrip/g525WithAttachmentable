A simple grails 5 app with an inlined grails 5 version of the attachmentable plugin.

It includes a Person domain to which you can attach files.

As is, the files will be uploaded to your `~/coreGrailsApp/coregrailsapp.Person `directory.

This branch uses jquery 3.6.0 and compatible versions of required jquery plugins, the [master](https://github.com/leadtrip/g525WithAttachmentable) branch uses versions of jquery found with the attachmentable plugin which aren't compatible with the version of bootstrap bundled with grails 5.
